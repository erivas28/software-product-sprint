      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
          I truly enjoy learning new things in life, as I find them to be "curiosities". I feel 
          like this has been helpful throughout my academic career and personal life.
      </p>
      <p>
          My hobbies consist of playing soccer, spending time with my wife and kids, and smoking cigars!
